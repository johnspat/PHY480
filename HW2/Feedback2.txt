# Grading Scale: check(+) --> excellent codes and analysis
                 check    --> satisfactory (missing small gaps in analysis or codes)
                 check(-) --> unsatisfactory (significant problems with codes/analysis or incomplete)  

The code and results look good (correct slopes etc.). Two stylistic comments:

1) You use the same symbols for all 3 integration methods, which is even worse since
your plot is black and white (note that the HW asks for a color plot). So there's no
way to distinguish which is which (though of course I can infer it since I know what 
slopes I should expect for each). 

2) Whenever one fits some data/numerical points to some functional form (e.g., a line), 
it's a good idea for presentation and clarity to also plot the fitted line (with the fit
parameters shown in the legend). See some earlier examples in the notes/activities on how
to do this.

And one other comment:

3) Your analysis is correct with the exception of the "analytical" estimate of the optimal #
of points. (Your graphical estimates are good.)
